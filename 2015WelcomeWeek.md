# A Problem Solving Strategy {data-background="#f08" data-transition="fade-in fade-out"}

[George Polya; How To Solve It](https://notendur.hi.is/hei2/teaching/Polya_HowToSolveIt.pdf)


  1. First, you have to understand the problem.
  2. After understanding, then make a plan.
  3. Carry out the plan.
  4. Look back on your work. How could it be better?

# Understand {data-background="#00d414" data-transition="fade-in fade-out"}

##

  * What are you asked to find or show?
  * Can you restate the problem in your own words?
  * Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the problem?
  * Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
  * Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
  * Do you need to ask a question to get the answer?

## Exercise

Rewrite the 3 lights problem in your own words.

  * Use a formula
  * Be creative
  * Use your head

## The Muddy Children Problem

  1. $n$ children meet their father after playing in the mud. The father notices that $k$ of the children have mud dots on their foreheads.
  2. Each child sees everybody elseâ€™s foreheads, but not his own.
  3. The father says: "At least one of you has mud on his forehead."
  4. The father then says: "Do any of you know that you have mud on your forehead? If you do, raise your hand now."
  5. No one raises his hand.
  6. The father repeats the question, and again no one moves.
  7. After exactly $k$ repetitions, all children with muddy foreheads raise their hands simultaneously.
