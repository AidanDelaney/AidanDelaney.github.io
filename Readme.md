# A Collection of Lectures

As a long-time LaTeX user I've been migrating some talks to a more web-friendly format with a decent production pipeline.

## Pipeline

Slides are written in Markdown and converted to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentations.  I use the *super* awesome [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to perform the conversion.  Furthermore, as I need to produce well-rendered mathematical equations I use [MathJax](http://mathjax.org/).

## Features

* I keep a "local" copy of reveal and MathJax so that the presentations work offline (after cloning).
* Blur is applied to background images (to make foreground text more readable).
