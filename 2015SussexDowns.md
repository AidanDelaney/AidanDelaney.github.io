# What is Computer Science?

<blockquote>Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine. -- <cite>Wing, Jeanette M. (2006). "Computational thinking" (PDF). Communications of the ACM 49 (3): 33.</cite></blockquote>

# Or Less Abstractly

* The ACM is a global computer science society.
* Let's take the ACM's 1968 curriculum and the 2013 curriculum.
* Take the intersection to find the commonality.
* Then project into the future.

# 1968 {data-background='images/Agc_view.jpg'}

> * Apollo 7 carried a crew into space, Apollo 11 didn't fly 'till the following year.
> * 2001: A Space Odyssey was released.
> * Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick was published.
> * The Apollo guidance computer had a memory of 2048 16bit words and a clock speed of 2Mhz.

# 2013

> * Soyuz only delivers crew to the ISS.
> * Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami was published.
> * Intel CPUs run multiple cores at 3Ghz, connected to 8Gb of RAM (that's 512 16-bit words * 1024 * 1024 * 8).

If the technology is this different how can Computer Science be the same?
