# About Me

# What is Computer Science?

<blockquote>Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine. -- <cite>Jeanette M. Wing (2006). "Computational thinking". Communications of the ACM 49 (3):33.</cite></blockquote>

# Or Less Abstractly

* The ACM is a global computer science society.
* Let's take the ACM's 1968 curriculum and the 2013 curriculum.
* Take the intersection to find the commonality.
* Then project into the future.

# 1968 {data-background='images/Agc_view.jpg'}

> * Apollo 7 carried a crew into space, Apollo 11 didn't fly 'till the following year.
> * 2001: A Space Odyssey was released.
> * Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick was published.
> * The Apollo guidance computer had a memory of 2048 16bit words and a clock speed of 2Mhz.

# 2013

> * Soyuz only delivers crew to the ISS.
> * Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami was published.
> * Intel CPUs run multiple cores at 3Ghz, connected to 8Gb of RAM (that's 512 16-bit words * 1024 * 1024 * 8).

If the technology is this different how can Computer Science be the same?

# What is Computer Science?

<blockquote>Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. -- <cite>Edsger W. Dijkstra</cite></blockquote>

# <span style="color:black;">Computer Science 1968</span> {data-background="images/1968.jpg"}

# Computer Science 2013

# What's Common?

* Data Structures & Algorithms.
* Networking -- though the *nature* of the network has changed.
* Programming -- and lots of it.
* Statistics & Discrete Maths.
* Computer Graphics
* Computer Organisation

# What has been Added?

* Operating Systems.
* Social Issues & Professional Practice.
* Networked Applications.
* Human Computer Interaction
* (Frankly, a *lot* more).

# Future Projections

* Parallelism, Concurrency & Distributed.
* Functional (Haskell-like).
* More Statistics (Big Data, Machine Learning).
* eScience.
