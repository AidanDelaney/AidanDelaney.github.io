# Eastbourne CAS Hub

* the opportunity for teachers to meet in a relaxed and informal atmosphere
* to share ideas and resources
* to receive training, and
* to gain mutual support from discussing teaching methods with colleagues.

No question is too small or stupid! -- I'm sick of the antagonistic attitude in some tech-related quarters.
